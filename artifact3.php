                <p>A collection of intricately made brass and bronze sculptures and plaques from the palace of Oba Ovonramwen Nogbaisi. Created by specialist guilds working for the royal court. The plaques provide a historical record of the Kingdom of Benin, including the first contact with Portuguese emissaries. Many of the pieces were made for ancestral altars of past kings and queen mothers. The term "Benin Bronzes" is also used to refer to artefacts made from ivory, leather, coral and wood. In February 1897, the British launched a punitive expedition against the kingdom after seven British officials and traders were killed. Benin City was overrun; British forces looted the Royal Palace, which was burnt down. The oba, or king, was sent into exile.
