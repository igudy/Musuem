                <p>The Agboghidi mask is a detailed piece made by the father of master bronze Caster Nosa Omorodion.
It is a mask of the great warrior Agboghidi. Agboghidi was a strong fighter, who married a wife that had supernatural powers. Her knowledge of traditional medicine and her psychic ability made her husband feared by many.However, he became too confident and rebelled against the King. He did not succeed and he died.The King honored him, by directing the bronze casters to make a mask about him.
The snake represents the strong spiritual powers of Agboghidi given to him by his wife.
A rare piece, definitely recommended to purchase.
P.S:The coronation of the new King of Benin Kingdom takes place this October. Join in the celebration of hundreds of years of cultural richness and artistic excellence. Purchase this sculpture and help sustain the art of Bronze casting from the Ancient Kingdom of Benin City.
