                <p>While in England, the sculptures were coated with a layer of oil varnish and pigmented wax in a manner typical of practices used for caretaking and exhibiting Western sculpture at that time. In 1980, conservators at The Met began to remove these dark, colonial-period coatings in order to reveal the material nature of the surfaces below. Using careful solvent cleaning under high magnification, their work has revised our understanding of these works' original appearance, suggesting that brass production in Benin City fundamentally differed from methods prevalent in late nineteenth-century Europe.
In the Edo language, the phrase "to commemorate" (sa-e-y-ama) means literally to cast a form in brass, an alloy of copper and zinc whose color can vary from a reddish to a golden yellow. Figures such as the Horn Player, placed on court altars in memory of kings and historical events over a period of centuries, were reportedly kept bright and "very clean" (i.e. polished), both the metal and its brilliant color having ritual and royal connotations in Edo tradition. In modern-day Benin City, contemporary cast-brass casters continue to produce brass that is kept shiny and lustrous. The Horn Player, although originally meant to be seen with a polished surface, has long since acquired a greenish-brown corrosion layer resulting from years of exposure to the atmosphere.
