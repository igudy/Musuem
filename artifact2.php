                <p>Benin City still seek to chronicle events - like this one depicting the slave trade
                  Ernest Ohly distrusted strangers and lived in a world of cash and secret objects. He kept a suitcase of Â£50 notes under the bed.
                  "Ernie the Dealer" was the family nickname. The children grew up surrounded by art. But by the end he was tired of life.
                  His house was chaotic, his Persian rugs infested with moths. The family found the suitcase of banknotes but discovered they were no longer legal tender.
                  Ernest Ohly may have let things slide, but he had been a formidable collector.
                  "He and my grandfather never went to Africa or the South Pacific, but got their knowledge from being around objects," said Freida.
                  "There was a whole group of European dealers in London, in the 1940s through to the 1970s."
                  The British Empire was ending, and the deaths of its last administrators and soldiers brought rich pickings.
                  "I never understood why my father was so interested in reading obituary pages. The Telegraph, the Times, really studying them. If they were Foreign Office, armed forces, anything to do with Empire, he wrote to the widows."
