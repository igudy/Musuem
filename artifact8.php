                <p>Detail of the Horn Player displaying the reddish soil visible in the recesses of the figure's cast surface. Right: Close-up of red-brown particulate matter found on the surface.
What is this red-brown material, and why is it still present on Benin sculpture? Many believe that the red patina is merely wind-blown soil, the "red dirt of Benin" as described by British soldiers who collected the sculptures from palace storerooms. However, conservation treatment has shown us that rather than a friable layer of dust it is a very hard and compact material, difficult to separate or remove from the metal surface. Modern analysis has identified the red material as a fine iron-rich clay identical to the clay used for the casting core, and that it exhibits some mineralogical characteristics of a material subjected to high heat. This suggests that the material is actually the remains of the original fired investment layer, the initial clay coating that was applied to the surface of the wax model but never completely removed from the cast metal after firing.
Igbo Bronze Art
Most bronze sculptures were made in stages using the lost wax technique, an ancient casting process commonly using wax. Many of the castings integrated small decorative items and designs, showing the artisansâ€™ high level of skill. Some of the bronzes were likely part of the furniture in the burial chamber of a king or other noble. In addition to a variety of ritual vessels, bronze items include pendants, crowns and breastplates, staff ornaments , swords, and fly-whisk handles .
