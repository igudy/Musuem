                <p>The historical city of Benin, Edo State, is widely known for its art – Bronze plaques and sculptures. The bronzes, which were looted during the British punitive expedition of 1897, can now be seen in museum collections in Britain, Europe and America, making it about the most popular art culture and tradition in the country.
But that is not what has made the visual art landscape popular. Being a society that has a strong culture, the pulsating beats of art can be felt on the street. The landscape is dotted by art.
Art in ancient and present-day Benin is a way of life, an instrument used in articulating its peoples’ values, vision and voice. Highly conscious of their heritage, the locals in Benin never miss an opportunity to promote and talk about their culture, either through informal conversations over beer and pepper soup or through visual interpretations in the form of art.

The Benin artworks are robust, realistic and reflect the historical journey of the city state —- Being a society whose culture was not diluted by Western or Eastern ways, it was a model of pure traditional African society until the 1897 British punitive expedition led by Captain Harry Gallwey that resulted in the sacking of the entire Benin Empire.
So, as part of activities lined up for this year’s National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST) holding in Benin City, Edo State, a photo show that is living up to the objectives for which the festival was created, including deepening unity among Nigerians, is holding through the period of the festival.
With Images of Some Outdoor Sculptures in Benin, as theme, the exhibition, mounted by the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Tourism and Diaspora Affairs of Edo State in collaboration with National Gallery of Arts, takes visitors through a visual excursion spanning generations.
The exhibition showcases the rich visual art of the Benin people from the precolonial times when the empire was at its peak to the contemporary time, showing works that are executed in diverse media like bronze, brass, wood and concrete.
From John Danford’s bronze of Emotan (1954) to Greg Agnonkhoko’s Heritage, concrete (1993), the history of the kingdom resonated in colourful images. The 35 works told the story of Benin.
