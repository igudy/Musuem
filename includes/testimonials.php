                <p>&ldquo; It was an interesting experience. The system is so organized and professional. I learnt a lot from the ancient history of the tribe. Very polite and understandable staffs. The tour guard was so down to earth in his explanation despite we went so close to their closing time. You should visit and see this yourself.&rdquo;</p>

                I visited the musuem with my sister in 2001. 
                Sad that my mom is late. She told us all the beautiful things about Benin and the wonderful stories of the battle against the British Invasion into the Benin kingdom.
                You get to see life the place where these amazing stories happened.
